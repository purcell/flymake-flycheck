;;; Commentary:

;; The core of the package is the ability to wrap a single checker
;; into a flymake diagnostic function which could be added to
;; `flymake-diagnostic-functions':

;;    (flymake-flycheck-diagnostic-function-for 'sh-shellcheck)

;; Flycheck has the convenient notion of "available" checkers, which is
;; determined at runtime according to mode and availability of necessary
;; tools, as well as config for explicitly "chained" checkers.

;; Accordingly, you can obtain the diagnostic functions for all checkers
;; that flycheck would enable in the current buffer like this:

;;    (flymake-flycheck-all-chained-diagnostic-functions)

;; In practical terms, most users will want to simply enable all
;; available checkers whenever `flymake-mode' is enabled:

;;    (add-hook 'flymake-mode-hook 'flymake-flycheck-auto)

;; If you find that `flymake' is now running `flycheck' checkers which
;; are redundant because there's already a `flymake' equivalent, simply
;; add those checkers to the `flycheck-disabled-checkers' variable, e.g.

;;    (add-to-list 'flycheck-disabled-checkers 'sh-shellcheck)

;; Some caveats:

;; * Flycheck UI packages will have no idea of what the checkers are
;;   doing, because they are run without flycheck's coordination.
;; * Flycheck's notion of "chained checkers" is not handled
;;   automatically, so although multiple chained checkers can be used,
;;   they will all be executed simultaneously even if earlier checkers
;;   fail.  This could either be considered a feature, or lead to
;;   redundant confusing messages.
